					<p>It’s time to go “Beyond the Open.” Localpoint’s campaign reporting has been rebuilt from the ground up. Now you can extend what you know about campaign success to actually find out how much physical foot traffic you drove with a message.  See how app engagement becomes store engagement. SaaS consoles are convenient, and with our most recent upgrades we’ve given ours a complete update. However, this technology is most powerful when it becomes a seamless part of your marketing software infrastructure. Learn how our console is built entirely on an enterprise-class API layer called Bridge that you can access yourself. </p>
