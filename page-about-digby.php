			<h2>Digby: Powering Cross Channel Marketing</h2>
			<h3>Mobile is not a challenge, it is an opportunity.<br/>Mobile is the future.</h3>
			<p class="lead">Digby was founded in 2006 based on the idea that mobile technology would change retail forever.  Seven years later, we are proud to see our founding idea proved true.  As mobile retail has transformed from an extension of ecommerce to the linchpin of cross channel marketing, Digby has evolved as well.  From the early days of mobile commerce to the 2012 launch of Localpoint, <a href="/localpoint-platform/" title="Localpoint Geofencing Platform">a cross channel marketing platform</a> that engages consumers in and around brick and mortar store locations, mobile defines and differentiates us.</p>
